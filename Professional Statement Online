- 👋 Hi, I’m @seizewind
- 👀 I’m intereed in cybersecurity
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate
- 📫 

This a simple readme for my professional statement. 

This is seizewind, I am interested in entering the cybersecurity industry and currently studying the Google Cybersecurity Analyst Certificate and the Oracle Foundation Certificate.

My main interest is log reading and policy management of an organization. Simply reading through data and information then picking and choosing which one should be used for the particular tasks calls for. Using this interest, problem solving and organization satisfication in my work ethic and skills are key.

My strengths are time management and communication. Organizations need someone who is able to communicate procedures and policies well enough so that customers, coworkers, mangement and or vendors can understand what needs to be done.
Much of my free time will shore up my skills in SQL, Python, Azure and Splunk. Eventually I feel my skills will be enough to be a good fit for an organization.

As with everything this will be updated as time passes.
